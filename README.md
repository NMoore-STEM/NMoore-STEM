# Greetings,
## My name is Nick Moore and I am embarking on a monumental career change...
I come from a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) background.
Currently, I operate my own consultancy which provides scientific guidance and assistance to analytical labs across the US.  My contributions to my clientele range from training staff, calibrating analytical equipment, work-flow logistics, writing ISO17025-compliant SOPs, and coding/creating/automating results reporting.
&nbsp;
Although I have taken much enjoyment and learned many things from my career, I am looking for new opportunities which align with my inherent skills and pre-dispositons.  Web development absolutely fits the bill.
&nbsp;
I have always had an artistic inclination and feel at home delving into large, complex projects involving many small parts.  As an analytical chemist, I was able to leverage some of my strengths towards my career, but there were still aspects of myself that were not being engaged through my work.
&nbsp;
With web development, I am able to utilize all of my strengths to work together in creating a final product.
